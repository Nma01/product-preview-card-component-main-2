## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap



### What I learned

- I practiced CSS positioning and display.
Although, I tried several css properties targeted at achieving what I wanted. It was an interesting process, writing them and seeing what they actually do, how they turn out.

- I also tried using css media query. Understanding it was tough initially. I will say I am getting a hang of it little by little.

- Also, I got better at arranging & organizing my code, making use of comments for each section that I am working with in order to stay organized and on track.

- Naming classes was poor. Although they make some kind of sense to me. They may not make much for others. I named it that way based on my understanding and interpretation of the design.

- There were several repititons of property in several classes across , Code refactoring & DRY principle is one major area of improvement .

I am proud of the following: 

```
  BOOTSTRAP ===>

      That I was able to build the mobile version of this design using bootstrap is one major thing I am proud of. As this is my first implementation using the framework. 
      I even added a navigation bar to this project.
```

```
  CSS ===> My very first attempt at using media query.

    @media (min-width:767px) {
        .text-section {
                padding: 10px 15px;
        }

        .content-wrapper {
            padding: 50px; 
                  
        }

    }

```
